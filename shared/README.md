# Shared Folder

This folder contains code and resources shared between the backend and frontend of the monorepo.

## Structure

- `types/` - TypeScript types shared between backend and frontend
- `constants/` - Global constants usable in both
- `utils/` - Generic reusable functions
- `schemas/` - Validation schemas (e.g., Zod or Joi)
- `api/` - Common functions for API calls
- `config/` - Shared configurations between projects

Each folder is designed to be imported in both the frontend and backend.
